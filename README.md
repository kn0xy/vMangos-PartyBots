Tinkering with vMangos party bots.

<br>

### 3/22/2025 ###
- Added .partybot stay/unstay commands
- When staying, the bot will:
    - Not follow the party leader
    - Not chase targets in combat
    - Not run away from enemies
    - Still attack and cast spells at targets within range

- To use the command:
    - Select a party bot
    - Type .partybot stay to make them stay in place
    - Type .partybot unstay to make them resume normal movement

The bot will continue to participate in combat while staying, but will not move from their position. This is useful for setting up specific positions for fights or when you want the bot to hold a particular location.
